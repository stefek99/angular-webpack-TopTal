Write an application that tracks jogging times of users

* User must be able to create an account and log in (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone)
* When logged in, user can see, edit and delete his times he entered
* Implement at least two roles with different permission levels (ie: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on his owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, an admin would be able to CRUD on all records and users, etc.)
* Each time entry when entered has a date, distance, and time
* When displayed, each time entry has an average speed
* Filter by dates from-to
* Report on average speed & distance per week
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
* In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
* All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile app, disregard this)
* Bonus: unit and e2e tests!
* You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
